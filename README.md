# projects
A folder for pet projects.

This folder contains projects that are 'completed', meaning they serve their intended purpose 
but aren't necessarily the most refined or elegant that they could be. These would be seen as
'production ready' but could still see improvements, either in term of iterating more in loops
or defining more of the workings in functions.
